Hi, I'm Gwen!

I spend most of my time gaming (mostly Star Trek Online, Grand Theft Auto Online, and World of Warships), though when I'm not doing that, I'm either writing fanfiction or doing things in Python.

And by things in Python, I mean Twitter bots. I've made exactly one so far, which you can find at <a href="https://twitter.com/WednesdayAd2ams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferreer noopener">@WednesdayAd2ams</a> if you want to see the results of it.
